# README

This repo is for the **'Build A Command Line App In Golang'** series of blog 
posts/lessons.

The master branch of this repo will have updates for only the Lessons documentation
and can be found in the LESSONS/ directory of the repo.

Each lessons' code will be in its' own branch and build upon the previous lesson.   
If you are looking for a completed product in the master branch, you will not find
one here.  Soon I will open the completed apps repo, rest_easy, to the public 
but at this time, that repo is still private.

In addition to this repo, you can find out more about these lessons via my blog
[OGNT](https://ognt-io-hugo.herokuapp.com/) and shortly on YouTube where I will 
be publishing video versions of each lesson.
